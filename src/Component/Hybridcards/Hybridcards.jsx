                        <p>
                            Among today‚Äôs leading EV markets, China has the most limited access to home charging, resulting in a more extensive rollout of public charging infrastructure. In 2023, China accounted for 70% of global public LDV charging and is expected to maintain a similar share in 2035 according to the STEPS scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the availability of public chargers in China currently exceeds the global average (with fewer than 10 electric LDVs per public charging point), the government has recently introduced new guidelines to enhance the quality of charging infrastructure. In the APS scenario, the number of electric LDVs per public charging point is projected to rise from about 10 in 2023 to approximately 15 in 2035.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, China boasts one of the highest proportions of fast chargers within its total public charging infrastructure, accounting for approximately 45%. By 2035, both the STEPS and APS scenarios project the stock of public fast chargers to reach around 7.5 million, nearly six times the number available in 2023. In the APS scenario, the number of slow chargers is expected to rise to 8.2 million by 2035.

                            In Europe, the number of public LDV chargers is projected to grow to approximately 2.7 million by 2035 in both the STEPS and APS scenarios, up from around 730,000 in 2023. In both scenarios, about 80% of these chargers, or roughly 2.3 million, will be located within the European Union by 2035.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The United Kingdom aims to install at least 300,000 public chargers by 2030. In the APS scenario, the deployment of public chargers is somewhat slower but still provides sufficient coverage, with the total reaching 220,000 by 2030 and 300,000 by 2035.

                        <p>
                            As of 2023, we estimate there were 27 million home chargers globally, providing 150 GW of charging capacity and serving about 1.6 electric LDVs per charger. In the STEPS scenario, this stock is expected to grow more than tenfold by 2035, reaching over 270 million chargers. In the APS scenario, the number of home chargers is projected to approach 300 million by 2035.

                        <p>
                            In the APS scenario, the number of other private chargers is anticipated to increase up to 14 times by 2035, whereas public chargers will grow sixfold. By 2035, public chargers in both scenarios are projected to provide greater charging capacity than private chargers outside of homes. Overall, there will be an estimated 1.2 electric LDVs per charging point, including both public and private chargers, in 2035 in the APS, up from just over 1 per point in 2023.

                        <p>
                            For commercial vehicle drivers, as with personal EV owners, overnight charging of electric HDVs at depots provides a convenient system for charging vehicles while they are stationary. This approach also benefits from the ability to charge at relatively low power rates due to the extended time available. To implement this strategy effectively, a nearly one-to-one ratio of depot chargers to electric HDVs is generally needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the near term, the electrification of HDVs is expected to advance most rapidly in sectors with relatively short and predictable daily routes (under 200 km/day), such as city buses and urban or regional delivery services. Overnight depot charging is likely to address most of the charging requirements for these fleets.

                        <p>
                            In the APS scenario, over 99% of HDV chargers are expected to be depot chargers by 2030, with about 10% of the electricity provided by opportunity chargers. By 2035, the use and deployment of opportunity chargers will increase significantly, with their numbers more than tripling from 2030 to reach 100,000.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In total, the installed capacity of HDV chargers is projected to reach 2,000 GW in the APS by 2035. For context, global installed renewable electricity capacity was roughly 3,600 GW in 2022. Although the average capacity of an opportunity charger is assumed to be about four times that of a depot charger, opportunity chargers will still account for less than 5% of the total installed capacity for heavy-duty chargers in 2035.

                        <p>
                            Despite the initiatives by the Government of India and the potential of EVs, the sector faces substantial challenges, including a gap between the targeted and actual number of Public Charging Stations (PCS).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Ministry of Power‚Äôs revised guidelines in the 2022 Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles (EV) document set minimum targets for charging infrastructure, requiring stations every 25 kilometers along highways and roads and at least one station within a 3 km by 3 km grid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, a February 2024 report by the Ministry of Heavy Industries revealed that India has only 12,146 functional EV charging stations, falling significantly short of these targets. Bridging this gap is essential for promoting widespread EV adoption and achieving India‚Äôs ambitious environmental goals.
