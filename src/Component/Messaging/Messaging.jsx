                        <h3>Understanding AAC Devices and Usage</h3>
                        <p>
                            AAC devices vary widely in form and function. Examples include iPads, speech-generating devices (SGDs), eye-tracking systems, communication boards, and picture books.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AAC is typically classified into three categories:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>High-tech:</strong> Includes digital technologies like iPads and computers with text-to-speech software, amplifiers, and devices with pre-recorded messages. These are dynamic systems that allow users to generate various words and messages.</li>
                                <li><strong>Low-tech:</strong> Includes picture symbols, communication boards, and picture books. These are static, and their displays cannot be modified.</li>
                                <li><strong>No-tech:</strong> Includes sign language, gestures, facial expressions, and body language. These methods have been in use since ancient times.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h3>What Can an AAC User Communicate?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Absolutely anything! A key component of AAC is providing access to the necessary vocabulary. A speech therapist may teach or program devices based on the specific vocabulary needs of their patient. AAC vocabulary is categorized into core and fringe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Core vocabulary:</strong> This includes everyday nouns, pronouns, verbs, and question words. Since these terms are frequently used, high-tech AAC devices often feature shortcuts or autofill options to make them easily accessible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Fringe vocabulary:</strong> This encompasses words relevant to specific, less frequent activities. For instance, someone watching a football game might need sports terminology, while a visit to Disneyland might require names of various princesses, heroes, and villains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a clinical practice that supports or replaces impairments in speech-language production and comprehension, encompassing both spoken and written communication. AAC is part of the larger field of assistive technology, which involves using equipment, tools, or strategies to enhance daily living for individuals with disabilities or limitations.

                        <p>
                            The communication technologies driving this transformation are Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) for wired connections and 5G for wireless connectivity. Both are designed to deliver unified communication over a single network infrastructure, supporting services like time-sensitive operations that require deterministic, reliable, and low-latency communication.

                        <h3>TSN: Unified Industrial Communication with Ethernet</h3>
                        <p>
                            TSN, as defined by the IEEE 802 standards, enables Ethernet networks to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) for time-sensitive and mission-critical operations. It provides tools in four key areas: resource management, traffic shaping, fault tolerance, and time synchronization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, the IEEE 802.1 Qcc standard outlines resource management principles. In centralized configurations, a Centralized Network Configuration (CNC) is used for network devices, while a Centralized User Configuration (CUC) is used for user devices. TSN ensures deterministic latency for critical data through methods like scheduled traffic (IEEE 802.1 Qbv) and frame preemption (IEEE 802.3br and IEEE 802.1Qbu).
