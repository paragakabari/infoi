                            Following the frenzy surrounding the Diljit Dosanjh concert in India, the spotlight is now on Coldplay. The excitement for their upcoming concert in Mumbai has been electric, with fans eagerly trying to grab tickets for the three shows in January. In a surprising twist, a viral social media post has suggested an alternative ‚Äî a lavish trip to Abu Dhabi to see their performance while enjoying gourmet food.

                            Instagram blogger Balram Vishwakarma shared a screenshot of the Coldplay ticket booking page, pointing out the exaggerated prices charged by "black marketers" for the Mumbai shows. Instead of spending lakhs on tickets in Mumbai, he proposed a more budget-friendly option: a round-trip to the Middle East.

                        <p>

He also shared a detailed breakdown of the costs, including flights, accommodation, meals, transportation, and even tickets for the Coldplay concert in Abu Dhabi.
